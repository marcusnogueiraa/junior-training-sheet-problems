# Junior Training Sheet Solutions

Welcome to the repository of my solutions to problems from the **Junior Training Sheet (JTS)**, a comprehensive guide for newcomers to programming competitions like the **ICPC**. This sheet was created by **Dr. Mostafa Saad Ibrahim** and features **~950 problems** carefully selected to help participants develop their skills progressively.

## **What is Competitive Programming?**

Competitive programming is a mind sport where programmers solve algorithmic problems under time constraints. It involves a mix of problem-solving, mathematics, and coding skills. Competitions like the **ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest)**, **Codeforces rounds**, and others challenge participants to write efficient, correct solutions in a limited time.

- **ICPC**: A global competitive programming contest for university students. It involves team-based problem-solving with a focus on algorithms and data structures.
- **Codeforces**: A popular platform for competitive programming. It provides a wide range of problems, contests, and a vibrant community of programmers. Most of the problems in this repository are from **Codeforces**, with additional problems from platforms like **SPOJ**, **UVa**, and **HackerRank**.

## **About the Junior Training Sheet**

The Junior Training Sheet is a **roadmap for mastering programming skills**. Its **current version is V7.0**, and it provides two main styles of training:

### **Training Styles**

1. **Blind-Order Training Style** (Recommended)
   - Problems are distributed into levels: **A, B, C1, C2, D1, D2, D3**.
   - Each level gets progressively harder.
   - This method ensures a balanced and consistent learning path.

2. **Topics-Based Training Style**
   - Problems are categorized by topics (e.g., sorting, graphs) and difficulty.
   - Advantages:
     - Mastering specific algorithms quickly.
   - Disadvantages:
     - May reduce training quality by focusing too much on known topics.

I am using the **Blind-Order Training Style**, which aligns with the roadmap philosophy of gradual and consistent progress.

## **Structure of the Repository**

The repository is structured to match the levels and sets described in the sheet:

### **Levels**
- Each level (**A**, **B**, **C1**, etc.) has its own folder:
  - `level_a/`
  - `level_b/`
  - `level_c1/`
  - ...
  
### **Sets**
- Each level is divided into **sets** to organize problems into manageable chunks:
  - **Main Problems**: 
    - Example: `set_a1`, `set_a2`, etc.
    - **Purpose**: Problems in the same set tend to have a similar difficulty and build on related concepts.
  - **Optional Problems**:
    - Example: `set_op_a1`, `set_op_a2`, etc.
    - **Purpose**: Easier problems for extra practice or reinforcement.

This separation allows for focused practice and a better understanding of problem-solving progression.

## **Problem Evaluation**

To measure progress and improve systematically, I record details for each problem:
- Number of Submissions
- Reading Time
- Programming Time
- Debugging Time
- Total Time
- Problem Difficulty (rated on a scale of 1 to 10)

These details help refine strategies but are **not shared in this repository**.

## **Problem Color Coding**
The sheet uses colors to indicate problem characteristics:
- **White**: Codeforces problem.
- **Light Purple**: Basic knowledge problem (related to just-watched videos).
- **Dark Purple**: Knowledge problem (on previously learned topics; harder than basic problems).
- **Green**: Easier problem for multiple-level training.

## **How to Get Started**
1. Explore the sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iJZWP2nS_OB3kCTjq8L6TrJJ4o-5lhxDOyTaocSYc-k/edit?gid=84654839#gid=84654839).
2. Read the rules and guidance provided in the sheet.
3. Understand the roadmap and select your training style. (I recommend Blind-Order training.)

## **Links to Level Readmes**

Each level has its own README with problem lists, progress, and tips:

- [Level A](./level_a/README.md)
- [Level B]
- [Level C1]
- [Level C2]
- [Level D1]
- [Level D2]
- [Level D3]
